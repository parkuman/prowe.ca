description: "REACH is an app for Kingston locals and students to find current social events occurring around the city. Developed by me using Google's Flutter SDK, I learned a ton about UI design and UX, as well as state management. This app used a scoped-model state management system that was popular at the time among the Flutter community. This idea was brainstormed by my classmates and I in our first year Engineering Design & Practice course. After being tasked with finding an entrepreneurial solution to a problem, this was our best attempt at helping others find things to do other than homework on the weekends."
