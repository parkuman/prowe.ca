description: "Had a really fun time doing a hackintosh + laptop upgrade for my Matebook X Pro 2018 for the first time. Using OpenCore + community made kernel extensions I've got the latest version of MacOS Big Sur dualbooting with Windows from the same drive. Everything is super stable and running well. Noticed battery life has been actually BETTER on MacOS than windows - and running cooler too. 

Huge credit goes to Profzei who maintains the repo for the Matebook X Pro hackintosh."
