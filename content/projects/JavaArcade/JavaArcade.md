description: "Mahcrosoft arcade is an arcade made by my classmates and I using Java. It included our interpretations of classic arcade games, a global chat channel, and live highscore leaderboards! Using Google's Sheets API we managed to successfully compete for highscores on Tetris from the comfort of our own homes. Our teacher, Mr. Mah, didn't like the name too much though."
