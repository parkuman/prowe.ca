I’m Parker, an engineer and software developer taking an internship year. I'll be entering my 4th year of Computer Engineering specialized in Entreprenuership & Innovation @ [Queen’s University](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/undergraduate/ECEi.html) in 2022.

Ever since I was young I’ve loved to learn about technology and how I can build new things with it. I create things that people use and enjoy, including apps, websites, gadgets and computers.

Outside class I’m a leader in multiple teams which teach and spread interest in tech and engineering.

Aside from tech, I love camping 🏕, playing guitar 🎸, running and spending time with friends.
