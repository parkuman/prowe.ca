Noticed battery life has been actually BETTER on MacOS than windows - and running cooler too. Huge credit goes to Profzei who maintains the repo for the Matebook X Pro hackintosh.",

Using Tensorflow's Object Detection API we have created a detection algorithm to detect enemy robot hit plates. Automating this process has given us a considerable advantage against the competition, and we learned a ton in the process! We found that the way we labelled data, and differentiating between red & blue coloured plates had a considerable effect on how accurate our model was.",
