                    <h3>Robomaster AI Plate Detection Model</h3>
                    <p>As AI team lead of of Queens University's Robomaster Design Team, I've lead twenty students toward learning, designing and creating auto-targeting robot artificial intelligence. Using Tensorflow's Object Detection API we have created
                        a detection algorithm to detect enemy robot hit plates. Automating this process has given us a considerable advantage against the competition, and we learned a ton in the process! We found that the way we labelled data, and differentiating
                        between red & blue coloured plates had a considerable effect on how accurate our model was. And we still have more work to do!</p>

                    <h3>REACH: A Social Event App</h3>
                    <p>REACH is an app for Kingston locals and students to find current social events occurring around the city. Developed by me using Google's Flutter SDK, I learned a ton about UI design and UX, as well as state management. This app used
                        a scoped-model state management system that was popular at the time among the Flutter community. This idea was brainstormed by my classmates and I in our first year Engineering Design & Practice course. After being tasked with
                        finding a entrepreneurial solution to a problem, this was our best attempt at helping others find things to do other than homework on the weekends.</p>

                    <p>Mahcrosoft arcade is an arcade made by my classmates and I using Java. It included our interpretations of classic arcade games, a global chat channel, and live highscore leaderboards! Using Google's Sheets API we managed to successfully
                        compete for highscores on Tetris from the comfort of our own homes. Our teacher, Mr. Mah, didn't like the name too much though.</p>
